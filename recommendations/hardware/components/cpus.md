## Quick Look

_**Bold** for better value near prices shown._

- AMD X3D performs below the cheaper non-X3D variants of the same CPUs in low-to-medium productivity. It is an application-specific buy-in, only for high end machines.
- AMD 7000 is difficult to recommend due to only supporting DDR5 memory, a substantial additional expense outside of the highest end machines.
- AMD 5000 is a good all rounder, but does not compete with the latest Intel chips.
- AMD 4000 is generally poor for gaming, but offers good value for bargain-grade productivity.
- AMD 3000 can still offer good gaming performance, and bought used sits on a platform with a known-good upgrade path at excellent value for money.
- Intel 13
- Intel 12
- Anything prior to Intel 12 is a member of a platform with a known-bad last release (Intel 11) and is lacking substantial improvements made recently.

### Productivity

- Basic: Web Browsing, light office Work.
- Medium: Substantial multi-tasking, photo-editing, larger excel sheets.
- High: Video Editing, light CAD work, massive excel sheets.

## Intel

I have heard that generational improvement of Intel silicon is largely down to pushing more power for diminishing returns. While this adage may have been true for a time (14nm was almost exclusively in use from 5th gen / 2014 - 10th gen 2019) it no longer holds true. 12th gen Intel brought with them a new 10nm process and a move to a new naming scheme for such processes in line with AMDs naming, thus "Intel 7". It also brought a bit.LITTLE style core arrangement, with single-thread efficiency cores coupled with the existing dual-thread performance cores and continued DDR4 support throwing a substantial wrench in AMDs move towards price parity as a true competitor.
