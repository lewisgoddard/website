## Intel

I have heard that generational improvement of Intel silicon is largely down to pushing more power for diminishing returns. While this adage may have been true for a time (14nm was almost exclusively in use from 5th gen / 2014 - 10th gen 2019) it no longer holds true. 12th gen Intel brought with them a new 10nm process and a move to a new naming scheme for such processes in line with AMDs naming, thus "Intel 7". It also brought a bit.LITTLE style core arrangement, with single-thread efficiency cores coupled with the existing dual-thread performance cores and continued DDR4 support throwing a substantial wrench in AMDs move towards price parity as a true competitor.
